\subsection{Directly proving ``for all" statements}

If you want to directly (i.e.~without a contradiction argument) show a statement such as
\[
\begin{split}
	&\foralltext {a \in A},\\
	& \quad \dots
\end{split}
\]
you need to do the following.
You first need to introduce (i.e. define) the variable $a \in A$ by writing something like
\[
\text{Let } a \in A.\phantom{y}
\]
or
\[
\text{Take } a \in A \text{ arbitrary}.
\]
Next, you continue to prove the indented block on the next line.

In our example, we encounter this situation twice: in
\[
\begin{split}
&\foralltext \epsilon > 0,\\
&\quad \dots
\end{split}
\]
and in
\[
\begin{split}
&\foralltext n \geq n_0,\\
&\quad \dots
\end{split}
\]



For the statement 
\[
\begin{split}
&\text{for all } \epsilon > 0,\\
&\quad \textellipsis
\end{split}
\]
this comes down to writing 
\[
\text{Let } \epsilon > 0.
\]
\subsection{Directly proving ``there exists" statements}

If you want to directly (i.e.~without using a contradiction argument) show a statement of the form
\[
\begin{split}
& \existstext {b \in B},\\
&\quad \textellipsis
\end{split}
\]
you need to take the following {\bf two steps}.
 
{\bf First} you need to make a choice for $b$, e.g.~by writing
\[
\text{Choose } b := \textellipsis
\]

{\bf Second}, you need to verify that really $b \in B$.
If this is straightforward, you can just write
\[
\text{Indeed, } b \in B.
\]
But sometimes, it is more complicated than that, and you need some derivation, after which you can close off that derivation with for instance
\[
\text{We conclude that } b \in B.
\]
After showing that $b \in B$, you continue to show the indented statement $(\textellipsis)$ with that choice of $b$.

In our example we encounter this situation with
\[
\text{there exists } n_0 \in \mathbb{N} \text{ such that } \{ \dots \}
\]
We could for instance write:
\[
\begin{split}
&\text{Choose } n_0 := 10.\\
&\text{Indeed, } n_0 \in \mathbb{N}.
\end{split}
\]
and then continue with the proof of the block $\{ \dots \}$, with now $n_0$ fixed as $10$. 
Making choices is hard. With a bad choice, you won't be able to prove whatever is inside the block $\{ \dots \}$. In many of the proofs that you will write, this is probably the step that requires the most thinking, the most creativity. 

\subsection{Using a ``for all" statement}

There is a big difference between \emph{proving} and \emph{using} a ``for all" statement.
Suppose now you want to \emph{use} a ``for all" statement
\begin{mcodenumbered}\label{eq:forall-to-use}
	\begin{split}
		&\foralltext a \in A,\\
		&\quad \textellipsis
	\end{split}
\end{mcodenumbered}
What you then need to do comes in {\bf three} steps.

{\bf First}, you can write
\[
	\text{Use } a := \_\_ \ \text{ in (\ref{eq:forall-to-use})}.
\]
{\bf Second}, you need to verify that your choice of $a$ is really in $A$.
If this is obvious you can just write
\[
	\quad \text{Indeed, } a \in A.
\]
Otherwise, you can insert a longer proof here, that you can close with
\[
	\quad \text{We conclude that } a \in A.
\]
{\bf Third}, and finally, it is important to state the new fact that you have derived.
\[
	\text{It holds that } \textellipsis
\]

In the context of our running example, a fact called the Archimedean property can be relevant.
It says that for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$, there exists $k \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $x < k$.

In our proof, we could therefore state
\begin{mcodenumbered}\label{eq:result-archimedean-to-use}
\begin{split}
	&\text{By the Archimedean property it holds that}\\
	&\quad \foralltext x \in \mathbb{R},\\
	&\quad\quad \existstext k \in \mathbb{N},\\
	&\quad\quad\quad x < k.
\end{split}
\end{mcodenumbered}
Note that for now we only focus on the ``for all" part of this statement.
We can use this part now by writing
\begin{mcodenumbered}\label{eq:result-after-picking-in-archimedean}
\begin{split}
	&\text{Use } x := 15 \text{ in (\ref{eq:result-archimedean-to-use})}.\\
	&\quad \text{Indeed, } 15 \in \mathbb{R}.\\
	&\text{It holds that } \existstext k \in \mathbb{N}, x < k.
\end{split}
\end{mcodenumbered}

Note the similarities with when you want to \emph{prove} a there-exists statement.
Besides the similarity in form of these statements, there's also a similarity in that this is
usually a difficult step.
Finding a good value for $x$ can be difficult.

\subsection{Using a ``there exists" statement}

Now we will describe what we can do to \emph{use} a ``there exists" statement.
Suppose you know, or have already shown,
\begin{mcodenumbered}\label{eq:exists-to-use}
	\begin{split}
		&\text{It holds that } \\
		&\quad \existstext a \in A,\\
		&\quad\quad \textellipsis.
	\end{split}
\end{mcodenumbered}
Then you can \emph{use} this statement by writing
\[
	\text{Obtain } a \in A \text{ according to (\ref{eq:exists-to-use})}.
\]
Or, if (\ref{eq:exists-to-use}) it is the directly preceding statement, you can just write
\[
	\text{Obtain such an } a \in A.
\]

Returning to our example, after writing (\ref{eq:result-after-picking-in-archimedean}) we can continue by writing
\[
	\text{Obtain such an } k \in \mathbb{N}.
\]

\subsection{Brief summary of using and proving $\forall$ and $\exists$}

Using and proving forall and there-exists staments are closely related.
The differences can seem subtle, but they are very important.
Together with the similarities, they can help seeing the connections between the proof actions, 
and can structure the overall picture.
For this reason, we have made a brief summary of the four different options in a square table.
